# Code-Me_Python_Hackaton3

### Run Snake

Open a command-line and in the hackaton_3 directory run this:<br>
>$ Snake\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

This will run our virtual environment. If the activation of our virtual environment is successfull, you should see (venv) at the beginning of the command prompt line.
Then simply run Snake.py (e.g. in PyCharm).
